Calculating the Greatest Reliable Set :
Vocabulary atom list size = 50

The lfp(W_P(L)) cost time : 0.120

Final Consequence : a_12, a_33
Final Consequence size = 2

The GWRS of NLP is : 
The GWRS size of NLP = 0
The GWRS cost time = 0.000

The GSRS of NLP is : 
The GSRS size of NLP = 0
The GSRS cost time = 0.010
