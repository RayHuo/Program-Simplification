Benchmarks from Dr. Ji record:

running time cost : slow/middle/fast
result : positive/negative simply for good and bad

Base on the new modification : ignore all facts which are also in WFM, while running GWRS and GSRS
Benchmarks              Situation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NLP/channelRouting      negative, GWRS and GSRS are both empty
NLP/EqTest              negative, GWRS and GSRS are both empty
NLP/HamiltonianPath     negative, GWRS and GSRS are both empty
NLP/SchurNumbers        still middle speed and positive
NLP/RandomNonTight      still very fast but negative, all GWRS and GSRS are empty
NLP/RLP-150             still very fast but negative, all GWRS and GSRS are empty
NLP/RLP-200             still very fast but negative, all GWRS and GSRS are empty

NLP/15-Puzzle           positive, GWRS get some size, GSRS is empty
NLP/labyrinth           small test case will get both GWRS and GSRS's size = 1

DLP/Hampath             negative, GWRS and GSRS are both empty
DLP/RandomQuantifiedBooleanFormulas    still very fast and GWRS is positive, GSRS is empty 
DLP/StrategicCompanies  negative, GWRS and GSRS are both empty
